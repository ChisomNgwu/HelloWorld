QUESTION: meaning of meta charset UTF-8 in html.

ANSWER>>>
   The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag in HTML serves an essential purpose. Let’s break it down:

>>>CHARACTER ENCODING:
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
It tells web browsers how to interpret and display the text content of the webpage.
In this case, UTF-8 is the chosen character encoding.
>>>UTF-8:
UTF-8 stands for Universal Character Set + Transformation Format—8-bit.
It is a widely used character encoding capable of representing all possible characters (called code points) in the Unicode standard.
Unicode encompasses a vast range of characters, including letters, symbols, emojis, and more from various languages and scripts.
>>>WHY USE UTF-8?:
UTF-8 is recommended because it covers almost all characters and symbols in the world.
By using UTF-8, web developers ensure that their webpages can display content correctly regardless of the user’s language or character requirements.
In summary, <meta charset="UTF-8"> ensures that your webpage’s text content is encoded in a way that accommodates diverse characters and maintains consistency across different devices and browsers.
